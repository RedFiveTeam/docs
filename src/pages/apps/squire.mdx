[^1]: Develop is updated any time a feature branch is merged into `develop`, it is unstable and often broken  
[^2]: Production is updated when `develop` gets merged into `main`, this is the live product, once we reach a release

## Goals
Squire's purpose is to fill the gap left behind as AFTR and TBA users transition to TFTR. At this point, TFTR feels like
vaporware, so the group felt the need to develop a fix. Red Five to the rescue!

### Steps to Develop Squire

1. Clone a local copy (will require an account with NGA):

```shell-session
git clone https://gitlab.gs.mil/DGS1SDT/Squire.git
```

1. Enter the `Squire` folder:

```shell-session
cd Squire
```

1. Setup a MySQL database for Squire:
   Login to MySQL:

```shell-session
mysql -u <your_mysql_username> -p <your_mysql_password>
```

Create the database for Squire -> `squiredev`:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE squiredev;
```

Exit mysql:

```shell-session
quit
```

1. Start the backend server:

```shell-session
mvn spring-boot:run
```

1. Watch the output for the following:

```shell-session
Started SquireApplicationKt in 9.828 seconds (JVM running for 10.932)
```

1. In a second terminal session, enter the `frontend` folder:

```shell-session
cd Squire/frontend
```

1. Install the front-end dependencies:

```shell-session
npm install
```

1. Start the front-end server

```shell-session
npm start
```

1. When the following message is displayed, you can browse to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to start interacting with Squire:

```shell-session
Compiled successfully!

You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://172.25.35.66:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

### Congrats! You've got a local Squire development instance!
